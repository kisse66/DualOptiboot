This version adds support for I2C EEPROM as an alternative to original SPI flash.
Code assumes AVR HW twi (I2C). Arduino Uno uses pins A4 (SDA), A5 (SCL).

Most 24(L)C256 or 512 EEPROMs should work as is.

To exclude SPI flash code and use I2C EEPROM uncomment USE_I2C_EEPROM in optiboot.c
and recompile the bootloader. Until the code is optimized (?), it won't fit on 1kB
boot block as does the SPI version. So to use this make sure your fuses are set to
the maximum boot block size of 2kB (1024W).
